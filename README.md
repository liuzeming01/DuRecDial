# DuRecDial

In this paper, we provide a **bilingual parallel** human-to-human recommendation dialog dataset, **DuRecDial 2.0**, to enable researchers to explore the challenging task of multilingual and cross-lingual conversational recommendation. The difference between DuRecDial 2.0 and existing conversational recommendation datasets is that the data item (Profile, Goal, Knowledge, Context, Response) in DuRecDial 2.0 is annotated in two languages, both English and Chinese, while other datasets are built with the setting of a single language. We collect **8.2k** dialogues aligned across English and Chinese languages (16.5k dialogs and 255k utterances in total) that are annotated by crowdsourced workers with strict quality control procedure. DuRecDial 2.0 provides a challenging testbed for future studies of monolingual, multilingual, and cross-lingual conversational recommendation.

DuRecDial 2.0 is an extension of the [DuRecDial](https://baidu-nlp.bj.bcebos.com/DuRecDial.zip). Specifically, we extend the DuRecDial to English by crowdsourced workers with strict quality control procedure.
